# Conversation-Mixer-Tool

**Conversation-Mixer-Tool** is a Python-based utility designed to process and merge two audio files (caller and receiver) into a single conversation-like audio output. This project uses advanced audio processing techniques, including speech detection, bandpass filtering, and noise reduction, to create seamless audio.

## Features

- **Speech Detection**: Identifies speech segments from audio files using the Silero VAD model.
- **Audio Interleaving**: Merges caller and receiver audio segments into a realistic conversation.
- **Bandpass Filtering**: Removes unnecessary frequencies for cleaner audio.
- **Noise Reduction**: Reduces background noise for enhanced clarity.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Adds fade effects for seamless transitions between segments.
